- Hi, I’m @Yerachmiel-Feltzman
- I’m interested in Data Enginering and clean code best practices, as:
     data modeling, data quality, monitoring, big data processing (stream and batch), data lineage, data architecture
     code design, modular code, tdd, so on and so forth.
- I’m currently learning more on data modeling and ML models productization. 
- I am reachable through LinkedIn on linkedin.com/in/yerachmielfeltzman.
- You're welcome to read some of my latest technical articles on medium.com/@yefeltz. 
- My favorite quote (from one of my tech leads): `Write your code as if you’re going to delete production`
